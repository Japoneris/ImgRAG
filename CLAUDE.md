# Repo organization

- `img_env/bin/activate`: virtual env
- `data/`: DB files
- `docs/`: List of implemented features. Filename should follow the format `004-my-implemented-feature.md` (increase the number each time you add a new document).
    ALWAYS write a documentation when implementing a new feature. It can be very short if small feature.
    (yet, do not add it if it is just updating the requirements or fixing a typo).
    
- `src/` Main code directory
- `test_images/`: Example folder
